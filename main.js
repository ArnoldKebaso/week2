//Please CHECK the README.md for more EXPLANATIONS and DO THE EXERCISES that are done there too.

// TRY OUT THIS CODE, TYPE THEM AND PRINT, CHANGE THERE VALUES AND PRINT, CREATE NEW VALUES ADD VALUES AND PRINT.


//string data type
const firstName = "Jane"; //we are using const for constant, because the value firstname can not change.
let lastname = 'Doe'; // using single quotes, and value can be changed because we are using let 
                        // to define the variable.
lastname = 'Smith'; //Jane is married and her lastname is changed, because we used let,
                    //we can re-assign a new value in the lastname variable, because of let.
                    // let it be this now, later we can change it. thats what it means

//Boolean data type
const isJaneMarried = true // see that we did not wrap the true with a quotation symbol.
const itChangedBecauseOfLet = true; //because we used let in lastname variable, we could change the value
                            // to another string value.Your variables can be long too, but please make them short and precised.
const canItChangeWithConst = false; //no we cant change the he data type of the value boolean stored
                                    //with const to a different data type like number iside the variable.

const isItTrue = true; //booleans have either a true or false value and are mostly used with logical operators
                        //remember the true or faluse is in small letters and are not wrapped with quotation marks, just like strings.
                        //if you wrap the booleans with quotation mark you will get a string value stored.

//number data type
let age = 45; //we are using let here, because the value of thevariable ca change.


// ASSIGNMENT
//Please follow insructions.
//create the variables
//print out your values.

// 1. Create a variable firstname, lastname and email, given it the value of string.Your fristname, lastname and email address.
//2. Create a variable of number given it the value of your age.
//3. Create a variable iAmLearningJavaScript and give it a boolean value of true.

//Advanced question, please do attempt them, make research and solve it.

//4. Create a variable name called sentence and assign it a value of the concatenation of the other variables, making a sentence with it. 
//hint: "My name is Kennedy Chukwu, I am 15 years old and it's true am learning Javascript".
